# Chromeudfs_console
Using ChromeUDF and then opening a page in chrome, starting console and issue commands.

*Usage in scenario*
- Block userinput.
- Opening Chrome with a set page.
- Opening Console (F12).
- Copy and paste some commands.
- Execute.
- Open userinput.

**Why?**
Couldn't find anything that would help at the time being for manipulating console in a good manner.
